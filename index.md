#### pmemkv

**pmemkv** is a local/embedded key-value datastore optimized for persistent memory.
Rather than being tied to a single language or backing implementation,
**pmemkv** provides different options for language bindings and storage engines.

The C API of pmemkv is documented in the following manuals:
* [libpmemkv.3](https://pmem.io/pmemkv/master/manpages/libpmemkv.3.html)
* [libpmemkv.7](https://pmem.io/pmemkv/master/manpages/libpmemkv.7.html)
* [libpmemkv_config.3](https://pmem.io/pmemkv/master/manpages/libpmemkv_config.3.html)

The C++ API of pmemkv is documented in the Doxygen documentation available
[here](http://pmem.io/pmemkv/master/doxygen/index.html).
