 * you may want to create pool by hand - use one of the following commands.
 *
 * For regular pools use:
 * pmempool create -l -s 1G "pmemkv" obj path_to_a_pool
 *
 * For poolsets use:
 * pmempool create -l "pmemkv" obj ../examples/example.poolset
 *
 * Word of explanation: "pmemkv" is a pool layout used by cmap engine.
 * For other engines, this may vary, hence it's not advised to create pool manually.
