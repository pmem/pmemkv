# Performance reports

We've executed benchmarks to get an idea what approximate order of magnitude should
be expected. For most cases we used [pmemkv-bench](https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv-bench/)
benchmark, based on leveldb's *db_bench*.

See each individual pdf report for Hardware, OS, Software, benchmarks, etc. details.

Currently available reports:
* [Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Platinum 8280L + Ubuntu 20.04 kernel 5.4](./kv_perf_2021_Apr_Xeon_Ubuntu20.04.pdf)
